        <h2>Introduction (Why are my students failing?</h2>
        Originally starting work in HE as a teacher of computing related topics,
        I quickly noticed high failure rates in subjects, notably programming. <br>
        <br>
        It used to bug the hell out of me. <br>
        <br>
        In part this was down to the fact that running a university module with
        failure rates above a certain threshold brought you to the attention of
        the “powers that be” in not necessarily a good way. I also found it
        personally irritating. <br>
        <br>
        My natural instincts however are to try and untangle great big Gordian
        Knots and this seemed like a biggie. <br>
        <br>
        Why is it that no matter what I seem to do, topics such as programming
        seem to come with a very long tail of bad grades, perhaps akin to a
        snake. <br>
        <br>
        My initial theory was as follows… <br>
        <br>
        “The students are thick”. <br>
        <br>
        It made sense, and it did make me feel better and it did help at least
        to shift to the blame, it also helped to build close ties to other
        like-minded colleagues. <br>
        <br>
        But there was still a nagging feeling that there may be some part of the
        story missing in this explanation.
        <br>
        <br>
        I often found myself reflecting on my own story. <br>
        <br>
        In the early 1980’s having failed most of my A Levels I set out to a
        place called Leicester (I believed was in the northeast of England) to
        embark on a two-year HND in Applied Biology. By the end of the first
        year, I was on the verge of being thrown off the course, but this was
        resolved by a friend on the teaching team advising the assessment board
        of “mitigating circumstances”. <br>
        <br>
        Whilst there was a lot going on for me at that point in my life to be
        fair looking back, I am not sure going to the pub every night for much
        of my first year was helping nor could it really be described as
        “mitigation”. However, it gave me a second chance, and I continued to
        the second year of the course. I did OK with the added stability I was
        finding, but by the end I was done with Biology. I now had a clear idea
        that it wasn’t for me. After this I messed around for quite a while in
        rubbish sales jobs and the dole. <br>
        <br>
        Here is the thing. <br>
        <br>
        Somewhere around the age of 15 I had to select my options for school. I
        wanted to do Art and possibly Music, I really wanted to do something
        involving Computers given I was the only person I knew who owned one (A
        Sinclair ZX80 eventually ZX81 and then Spectrum) <br>
        <br>
        But no! <br>
        <br>
        I could predict the response from my mum on the Arts/Music front but was
        also explicitly told “you won’t be able to make a career in computers;
        there will never be any money in it.” <br>
        <br>
        So, I opted for Biology, Physics and Chemistry. I was supposed to carry
        on to a happy career in Chemistry in the glamorous locales of Runcorn
        and Widnes working at ICI. As my first year in the lower 6th progressed
        by Christmas I had given up Physics as I just couldn’t keep up with the
        complexity, and by the end of the 6th form I had failed Chemistry and
        squeaked a “pass” in Biology, so I was handed my “go directly to HND
        Biology card”, do not pass Runcorn, do not collect £100 from each
        player. <br>
        <br>
        Was I stupid? <br>
        <br>
        If you asked me back then I may have agreed. <br>
        <br>
        But looking back I know that I wasn’t. During 30ish years in academia I
        have done well thank you. <br>
        <br>
        I went down the pure science route because I thought that was what I was
        supposed to do. I delayed going down the computing route because I was
        discouraged on financial grounds. <br>
        <br>
        And it was this personal experience that was really bugging me with me
        students. <br>
        <br>
        What if like me they were not stupid but for what ever reasons they were
        pursuing paths for completely incorrect and unappealing motives? <br>
        <br>
        So, off the back of this I decided to investigate how people learn and
        what motivates them to learn. <br>
        <br>
        I took a PgCert HE, I became a Teaching Fellow, I completed an MA in
        Education Research always at the back of my mind trying to get a grip on
        this question “why do students fail?” <br>
        <br>
        Any you know what after all those years all that study and all those
        qualifications and all that hard work, you know what? <br>
        <br>
        I honestly believe I still missed it. <br>
        <br>
        Three years ago, I was fortunate enough to take early retirement, but
        the fact is there is still this burning ember in my brain surrounding
        this question of student failure. <br>
        <br>
        I still read around the topic and then something dawned on me.
        <br>
        <br>
        What if the problem isn’t intelligence, what if the problem is
        imagination? <br>
        <br>
        I have spent quite a while sitting with this idea, the more I think
        about it the more I find that it opens a whole new way of framing the
        world. <br>
        <br>
        There are a couple of instant observations to note. <br>
        <br>
        If the imagination is central to human life and endeavour, then why do
        we not spend more time talking about it? It seems to me that for most
        part around the age of 15 we are essentially told “stop dreaming and get
        with the programme”. This suggest that the imagination is at some level
        incompatible with being an adult.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, if as an adult you do pursue a career in obviously
        imaginative pursuits like the arts you will always have one eye in the
        mirror as you see a “proper job” tailing you should this whole “creative
        thing” lead to poverty. <br>
        <br>
        So, this sends a clear message that the imagination is solely the domain
        of children, artists who can afford it and loonies. <br>
        <br>
        But if academic failure for example is linked with the imagination and
        not intelligence then perhaps, we need to really talk about the
        imagination and the role it plays a lot more. <br>
        <br>
        The other item of note is to look with wonder at the role that
        imagination has played in the rise of humans as a species. <br>
        <br>
        Animals make tools, from birds’ nests, to apes using stones to crush
        seeds. <br>
        <br>
        Humans however are the only animal on the planet to look at two stones
        and use one to sharpen the other and create a flint knife. They then use
        that knife to cut dried animal skin and wood, add a suitable stone and
        you have a basic sling shot. <br>
        <br>
        We don’t just make tools; we imagine new ways of making new tools out of
        the tools we already have. This creates a direct line from the first
        flint axe to modern AI and genetic engineering. <br>
        <br>
        So…. I feel a need to organise my thoughts on this. Initially in an
        informal manner as a blog but perhaps more formally as something else as
        I refine my ideas. <br>
        <br>
        Some of the writings will be tentative perhaps even wrong but this is to
        some degree a data dump of ideas that are now no longer a burning ember
        but a source of some excitement and even perhaps discomfort at the
        rising mental temperature. </article>
