        <h2>Part 5 The Apple Falls by the Tree</h2>
        I assumed she would be pleased. There were no mobile phones back then
        and there was no phone in the halls of residence. I used to walk down
        the road to a phone box and ring mum from there. It was 1986 and I had
        just been baptised. Mum seemed upset with me though. "What is the name
        of your church?" “Just a group of Bible believing Christians” I told
        her. That wasn’t good enough for her. <br>
        <br>
        “You do know that now you are baptised Matthew you will come under God’s
        judgement?” “No” I replied. “Before you were an un-baptised non
        Christadelphian you won’t be judged by God when Jesus returns, you stay
        in the grave." "OK!" "Now you are baptised non Christadelphian you will
        be raised, judged and experience the second death!” <br>
        <br>
        God seemed to be going to a lot of trouble simply to make a point.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having prayed Jesus back into my life things were starting to pick up. I
        felt a lot better about myself. I had stopped drinking completely, I was
        remembering to wash myself properly and making a genuine effort to turn
        up to classes.
        <br>
        <br>
        The situation with the “love of my life” had changed too. Now that I had
        converted we were in a pretty weird place. Previously she wouldn’t go
        out with me due to me not being a Christian. Now she still wouldn’t go
        out with me because I was! She was deeply suspicious of my conversion. I
        respected this so we were just going to be "friends". That was true, at
        least for this moment in time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Given that she was an evangelical Christian, she had opted for the
        slightly odd position of refusing to invite me to her church. Nor would
        she tell me what or where the church was. Clearly in her head it was
        better I face the flames of Hell than stand any chance of going out on a
        date together. Perhaps she should have just told me she just didn’t like
        me?
        <br>
        <br>
        I was left to fend for myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, what are Christians supposed to do? Err, read the Bible? I didn’t
        have one. Where do you even get Bibles from? I had never seen them for
        sale in Sainsbury! I also guess I should start going to church too. But
        where? The Christadelphians were not an option; I had done with that I
        needed something different. There was a local Catholic Church, perhaps I
        should go there? My friend suggested I should go to Holy Trinity, an
        evangelical Anglican church, "very popular with students". <br>
        <br>
        I wasn’t used to getting up on a Sunday so early; it felt like a pain in
        the arse. The first meeting was really strange. It seemed to involve
        lots of rather dull hymns, standing up sitting down and having to turn
        round and talk to strangers at seemingly random intervals. I had no idea
        what giving your peace to somebody else even meant. I did buy a Bible
        though, a small NIV. There was a stall and I assumed they gave them away
        for free. To my horror I found you had to pay for the things!
        Fortunately I did have enough money on me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I attended a few times and started going to some mid week Bible study
        group. It all seemed terribly facile and shallow; the Bible hardly got a
        look in. Some people saw Bible study as something akin to sticking a pin
        in a map when deciding on a day out. Randomly select a passage and do
        what it says, such is the will of the Lord! I had rejected the
        Christadelphians but I felt there should be more weight to it than this.
        I felt horribly dissatisfied.
        <br>
        <br>
        I asked my future ex girl friend (current emphasis on friend). She
        reluctantly agreed to take me to the church she was attending.
        <br>
        <br>
        They met in the YMCA in town. After the meeting, the group adjourned to
        a very large house off London Road. Everybody seemed so friendly and
        excited about what they were doing. Given that I was still pretty lonely
        and messed up it had a massive impact on me. Everybody was so
        fantastically friendly. I felt like I had come home to the most
        wonderful family environment I could imagine. They sang together prayed
        together and laughed together. I wasn’t clear why, but there were no
        instruments at the meeting. The singing was amazing, four part harmony
        and real enthusiasm. The Bible was front and centre. During the sermon
        the members of the congregation flipped pages at speed, always keeping
        up with the preacher. I felt slow and inadequate in comparison.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wanted more, this was fantastic.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main preacher was American, also there were a group of young people
        from some Bible college in the States. It was clear there was some
        connection with the US. I asked “what is the name of your church?” The
        answer came back, “Just a group of Bible believing Christians”. That
        wasn’t good enough for me. <br>
        <br>
        "We are not a denomination! We are simply Christians wanting to restore
        first century belief and practice." This made some sort of sense but it
        also felt odd and unsatisfactory. “Whatever” I thought, “I want more of
        this fellowship”.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pretty quickly I met with the younger preacher, an Irishman from Belfast
        with a wonderful accent. He was always telling Irish jokes and laughing
        his head off. We started studying the Bible together, we became good
        friends. I was very confused by the Bible. The preacher was clearly very
        interested in getting to the baptism bit with some urgency, so in July
        1986 I was baptised in Loughborough. I was now a member.
        <br>
        <br>
        Officially through the door more details started to emerge as to the
        nature and history of the group. The church building in Loughborough
        said “Church of Christ” outside, at least the group has a name.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started to ask questions and found that the group in Leicester wasn’t
        quite as disconnected as I was first informed. Although there was no
        central organisational head office this was clearly still a
        denomination, especially given their refusal to meet with any other
        group that didn’t meet their definition of the “one true church”. I
        remember reading a directory of Churches of Christ groups in America.
        Each congregation has small print associated with it to identify what
        sort of one true church they were. There were such categories as “one
        cup” and “Sunday school”. This information was required so that visitors
        knew what sort of group they were getting into. If you felt that God was
        going to send to Hell anybody who insisted on using multiple cups during
        communion then you were best avoiding such groups. Perhaps you felt that
        Sunday school had no place in Sunday worship, in which case find another
        more suitable group. Not only were the Church of Christ clearly
        denominated from other Christian groups they were clearly denominated
        and divided even amongst themselves. Yet in spite of this they claimed
        to have “the truth”, “the way of salvation”, not grasped by anybody
        else. This was all starting to feel horribly familiar!
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember once at a church meal or “pot luck” picking up a children’s
        musical instrument. It wasn't Christmas but for some reason I played
        “Once in Royal David’s City”. The person I was with raised their eyebrow
        and looked very uncomfortable. Picking up the non verbal signals I
        stopped and wondered what that was all about?
        <br>
        <br>
        The “gospel” of the Church of Christ might be summed up as follows;
        believe, repent, be baptised and never use any musical instrument during
        worship. God will not be happy. As a group they are fixated with the use
        of instruments in worship. The logic is that there is no evidence in the
        New Testament that the church used instruments in worship. There is
        likely some measure of historical truth to this but the real question is
        so what? Does the creator of the universe actually get uptight about
        such things? At the final judgement will God say "well my friend you
        have lived a pretty good life but you once sang All Things Bright and
        Beautiful using guitar accompaniment, to Hell you go"?
        <br>
        <br>
        The "logic" runs something like this though. They try to be silent where
        the Bible is silent and speak where the Bible speaks. If something isn’t
        mentioned in the Bible then it has no place in one’s walk with God. <br>
        <br>
        The same could also be said for potatoes! Potatoes get no mention in
        either Old or New Testament. Is God therefore displeased with believers
        eating chips at a fellowship meal?
        <br>
        <br>
        When not claiming to be directly linked to the first century church it
        was occasionally possible to have more sensible conversations and get a
        better sense of the history of the group. The Church of Christ traced
        its history back to the restoration movement in America during the 19th
        Century. Alexander Campbell was a leading figure at the time. What I
        also discovered was the Christadelphians were an off shoot of this same
        restoration movement. Dr Thomas the founder of the Christadelphians had
        fallen out with and ultimately separated from the “Campbellites”, in the
        process splitting a number of churches in the UK. <br>
        <br>
        I felt I had come a long way joining this new group, but clearly not. It
        seems the apple really does fall by the tree.
        <br>
        <br>
        I found myself sort of back where I had started. The Church of Christ do
        have a different set of beliefs from the Christadelphians but they share
        the same legalism and authoritarianism. To name one important doctrine,
        Christadelphians believe in annihilation. The idea is that when you die,
        that's it. There is no Heaven or Hell. Christadelphians who have died
        will be raised at the last day and may be in with a chance of living for
        ever on a new Earth. Salvation for the Christadelphians is a bit like
        the National Lottery, "you have to be in it to win it"! Those who are
        not believers stay dead, eternal punishment is eternal annihilation, zap
        and you are gone! <br>
        <br>
        The Church of Christ subscribe to the more mainstream idea of eternal
        punishment in Hell. Anybody who is not a member of their church will be
        sent there to suffer eternally. Press them with a direct question though
        and will never be given a direct answer. "My sister who recently died
        always believed in God but was never baptised or heard of your church,
        is she in Hell?" You will get a diplomatic reply, something along the
        lines of "God will be the final judge not me". You can take the reply as
        a yes! On the up side their belief amounts only to intellectual ascent.
        They do not follow this theology to its logical conclusion it is mainly
        an academic exercise. This is not the case for the group I would later
        encounter.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the Church of Christ to be a true Christian you have to believe,
        repent and be baptised (by full immersion) into one of their churches.
        Then comes the inevitable ton of other stuff you have to believe and
        adhere to, mainly never using instruments in worship and then depending
        which version of the group you joined such things as mentioned above.
        One or many cups in communion? Sunday school or no Sunday school? Do we
        use real wine for the communion or is non alcoholic grape juice better
        due to alcohol being "liquid sin"? Do we use leavened or unleavened
        bread in communion? Make sure you subscribe to authorised doctrines. Be
        sure to attend the meetings. On and on it goes, the list is endless and
        perfectly illustrates the legalism that is rife within this and many
        other similar groups. I once had a conversation with a deeply unpleasant
        legalistic old timer who was upset with a new member from Nigeria. The
        new chap was banging his hand on the chair handle as part of his
        enthusiastic singing. The old timer didn’t like it as “hitting the chair
        in time to the music” in his book this counted as “using an instrument”
        and might “offend the Lord!” I am also not convinced skin colour wasn't
        a factor too!
        <br>
        <br>
        As is usually the case with deeply legalistic groups they really don’t
        give a damn about anything that really matters.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was the new kid on the block and one day in town I got chatting to a
        homeless person in the street. His name was Martin, I remember him well.
        We had a good chat about how he was doing so I invited him to church
        because that is what I thought I was supposed to do. We had free food
        and people who might be able to help him. Martin told me he didn’t have
        a watch so he might miss the meeting, so I told him “take my watch; you
        can bring it with you on Sunday”. When I told the preachers they were
        appalled. What was I thinking? I was clearly never going to see that
        watch again. Sunday came and Martin turned up watch in hand. I remember
        the preachers swooped down on him to warn him off. The last time I saw
        him he came to my flat. We had something to eat and chatted. He was a
        huge fan of Pink Floyd. We talked about records and music and then he
        left, I never saw him again. The last thing I remember him saying to me;
        “Once I had friends and people around me just like you, that is all gone
        now and it could happen to anybody.” He was so right!
        <br>
        <br>
        Around this time I told my mum that the group was called the Church of
        Christ. <br>
        <br>
        “The Campbellites!” she exclaimed, “I knew it!”. Apparently an old
        friend of the family Herbert Wilson used to be a member of the Church of
        Christ but had left to join the Christadelphians. I am still not sure if
        she was pleased, but at least it appeared to be something she could
        relate to and perhaps a position from which she could convert me. A
        period of letters, arguments and pointless destructive debates followed
        between the two of us.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was also another cloud on the horizon, part of a much larger
        storm.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were whispers of something called “The Crossroads Church”.
        <br>
        <br>
        It seemed there was an offshoot of the main church in America that had
        now started a church in London. Wasn't there already a church in London?
        They also used the same name Church of Christ but they were different,
        they were dangerous somehow, The London Church of Christ. It wasn’t
        clear how they were different. So far as I could tell, their beliefs
        seemed pretty much the same as the group I was in. They did care about
        spreading the word; they did appear to care about reaching out to the
        poor and homeless. More significantly they believed the whole Hell
        doctrine with deadly seriousness.
        <br>
        <br>
        They were also growing really fast. Our group was about twenty members
        on a good day, the London Church counted membership of around a
        thousand, what was going on?
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly in case you were wondering I finally went out with that girl,
        “the love of my life”.
        <br>
        <br>
        We lasted one week and nearly killed each other. We both had a lot of
        issues to work through and took out much of our difficulties and
        frustration on each other. The final row resulted in me calling a mutual
        friend out in the dead of night to assist her. I feared she might do
        something stupid. <br>
        <br>
        That mutual friend from the church eventually became my wife. </article>
