        <h2>Dad’s Dark Place</h2>
        Oh God it hurts <br>
        The pain wells up in my heart <br>
        A terrible swell of tight emotional skin <br>
        Squeezing tears from my eyes <br>
        I cannot see even though my eyes are open <br>
        I move my mouth and scream silently to myself <br>
        My fists lash out and beat the air <br>
        So many losses <br>
        So much gone both good and bad <br>
        The pain distracts and drains me <br>
        Sucking the life from my soul <br>
        I used to have so much to give <br>
        Now I have nothing <br>
        <br>
        There was once a man. Was he a good man? I am not so sure now. But he
        was a very ill man who had lost faith in what he once knew. The man was
        betrayed by close family members. Attacked and used by people he
        trusted. He was now trapped in a brutal cult. The cult offered only two
        options, comply or leave. Neither option was a viable choice. Leaving
        would come with such a high cost. Leaving could cost him his soul.
        Leaving could cost him his marriage. Leaving could cost him his friends.
        Leaving could cost him his reputation. Nor was compliance a viable
        alternative. Compliance would cost his integrity. Compliance could cost
        him his life. Compliance would drain the energy from his bones.
        Meaningful options were thin on the ground. There was no flight, there
        was no fight. The trap had been sprung, defeat was upon him. Like a
        terrified animal in headlights one option remained. Freeze to the spot
        and hope things come right. <br>
        <br>
        They never did. <br>
        <br>
        I am no longer sure who I am talking about now. <br>
        <br>
        Is it myself or is it my dad? <br>
        <br>
        For a big chunk of my life I asked one question “was I like my dad?” <br>
        <br>
        Trapped in this dark place I understood now the simple answer was “yes!”
        <br>
        <br>
        I was now trapped in dad’s dark place. <br>
        <br>
        This had always been the case from my earliest recollection to this dark
        pit of despair. <br>
        <br>
        Growing up I was simply doing what all children do, I was imitating my
        primary role model. <br>
        <br>
        For as long as I can remember dad didn’t work, he was always off sick.
        The same was also true of the Christadelphians, he couldn’t go there
        either. <br>
        <br>
        The problem is that he was bound to a very tiny life by his depression.
        The outside world was seen as a dangerous place that would rip you to
        shreds given half a chance. When visitors came to the house I remember
        him withdrawing to his bedroom. <br>
        <br>
        So, what did I do when we moved into a new school and a new area? When
        life became uncertain I followed the example of my primary role model
        and withdrew. I stayed at home, at home with my dad. Not only did I
        withdraw, I withdrew into the same physical space as him. Looking out at
        a terrifying world shoulder to shoulder simply served to re-enforce the
        deep sense of helplessness and fear of the outside world. It also sent a
        clear message that I was just not equipped to cope. <br>
        <br>
        When I was due to go to enter the workplace after my A levels I did the
        same. I was afraid of entering employment so I want off to study, it
        seemed the safest option. His shadow still loomed over me even though he
        had passed away. <br>
        <br>
        My membership of this group, this cult, had led me back again to his
        dark place. The parallels were stark. <br>
        <br>
        Like him I was now a piece of dead wood in this cult. <br>
        <br>
        Like him I was now a turd that refused to flush. <br>
        <br>
        I started to putrefy inside. <br>
        <br>
        There was a long black empty road stretching before me. <br>
        <br>
        Time ticked relentlessly on, days, weeks, months. <br>
        <br>
        Six years had gone by. How do I describe six years of nothing? <br>
        <br>
        My recollections of the period are vague and muddled. The medication
        certainly messed with my recall. <br>
        <br>
        Nearly two decades later shopping in ASDA a lady said hello to me. I
        sort of recognised her but really couldn’t remember from where. She
        clearly knew me. Apparently I had helped lay some slabs in her garden
        during that period. I couldn’t remember a bloody thing! <br>
        <br>
        It wasn’t really years of nothing. I did feel like my life was in limbo
        but there were friends, family, holidays, birthdays the usual stuff.
        These events were all seen through the fog in my head. There were also
        changes afoot too. My job in the software house was done; much of my
        time there spent on permanent sick, signed off by the GP. <br>
        <br>
        Then I had an idea. <br>
        <br>
        Given that much of the time I was helping friends and family with their
        computers I decided to set up as a self employed computer consultant.
        That was the first string to the bow. <br>
        <br>
        A few years previously I had done some part time teaching for the local
        University, this would be the second string. <br>
        <br>
        It worked well. Skills acquired on my MSc were used in both my teaching
        and my consultancy. Real world experience fed directly into my teaching.
        Finally I was doing something I cared about. I felt I was good at it
        too. <br>
        <br>
        Working at the University and working with local companies resulted in
        my meeting friends away from the cult. I was creating an escape route, a
        place to land when the time came to jump. <br>
        <br>
        I got out of the cult by connecting with people on the outside. Some are
        still in my life. They likely do not know what an important role they
        played. Nor was my escape plan conscious, it was something I did on auto
        pilot. <br>
        <br>
        My home life was not going well. <br>
        <br>
        I vividly remember there was an odd arrangement of chairs in the living
        room. I was sat on one of the dining chairs and my wife was sat on the
        sofa. I announced I was not attending any more meetings. I had realised
        there was a clear link between my mental and emotional health and
        contact with the group. I felt this day drew a firm line between the two
        of us. <br>
        <br>
        For a few years we had been travelling down to London to stay with her
        younger sister, she and her family had also joined. Now my wife’s entire
        family were in the group. <br>
        <br>
        I often didn’t go to meetings but was also frequently encouraged to
        attend, so from time to time I would show my face. <br>
        <br>
        It was during that time I had a realisation. This group is making me
        ill. I was half way through singing a hymn, I stopped and stood there in
        silence as those around me continued to sing. <br>
        <br>
        Every time I try to sing now in any context I have a flashback to that
        moment. Since that moment I have never felt able to sing with any
        conviction even to this day. That is one of the lasting casualties of
        this whole car crash. <br>
        <br>
        The decision to stop attending drew a line and left me labelled as
        damaged goods. I was now potentially the enemy, the heathen, the
        outcast. So I started acting like one! <br>
        <br>
        As in my teens I was self medicating on alcohol. Add to that the anti
        depressants, I was stacking on weight. Not eating properly I remember
        turning over in bed one night and my gut felt like it was on loan from
        Homer Simpson. <br>
        <br>
        I now felt there was absolutely nobody I could talk to. Opening up to
        anybody on the outside felt like a betrayal. But who would understand?
        My story seemed like insanity even to me. <br>
        <br>
        I was researching the ICC on the internet listening to the critics of
        the group. Chat rooms and web sites were full of horror stories matching
        my own experience. The cult was targeted by the national press even the
        BBC. I tried to share my findings with those closest to me but the
        evidence was dismissed as untrue or “isolated incidents”. Fake news
        invented by disgruntled ex members. <br>
        <br>
        My dad and I also shared another coping mechanism, both he and I used to
        walk. <br>
        <br>
        I would walk for miles each evening trying to figure out what to do. I
        prayed to God, I prayed to Jesus, one night I prayed to the Satan just
        to see if he had any ideas. None of them were home. <br>
        <br>
        One night, having been to the pub I was seriously off my face on larger.
        The pub was chucking out and I had a choice. Do I go home or do I walk?
        I could keep on walking and never turn back. Sleep on the streets,
        become one of those lost and forgotten people begging for cash. That
        night I decided to walk. If there were no buildings in the way I would
        have walked in a straight line to oblivion. I wanted to keep on walking
        leaving my life behind me. I wanted to feel it no more. Sometime around
        3 am I decided I couldn’t walk any further, the alcohol was wearing off
        and I had to make the long slow walk back home. My marriage and friends
        in the cult still formed strong bonds. <br>
        <br>
        I knew there was long dark night of the soul fast approaching. <br>
        <br>
        This night felt like a practise run. <br>
        <br>
        Then something happened that gave me a jolt. <br>
        <br>
        It was an ordinary day in the latter part of summer when I came
        downstairs to turn the telly on. I remember it well. I had borrowed a
        guitar from a friend of mine and was returning it that day. I took the
        remote and flipped through a few channels. Something flashed across the
        screen about one of the towers of the World Trade Centre collapsing. It
        didn’t quite register. I flipped channel a couple more times, stopped
        and then went back to the news. “What the fuck?” I watched dumbfounded.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the Twin Towers fell I didn’t just wonder “what the fuck?” I also
        wondered “what the fuck was I doing with my life?” </article>
