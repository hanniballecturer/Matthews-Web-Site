        <h2>Part 1 Apocalypse 1975</h2>
        It was the year of my birth when the prophecy was declared, the end of
        the world was coming in 1975. <br>
        When that year arrived I think for me in some sense the end did come. <br>
        <br>
        To say that life growing up was gloomy would be something of an
        understatement.&nbsp; I was raised in a pre-millennial religious cult
        called the Christadelphians (CDs for the sake of typing sanity).&nbsp;
        As a group they spend a lot of time waiting (lots of waiting) for the
        return of Jesus and the coming kingdom of God. This return will require
        the incineration of the majority of the global population. (This of
        course depends on if you are a CD or not, after all, they are the only
        ones who really have "the truth"). <br>
        <br>
        I am still not 100% clear to what extent the CDs are “officially”
        dispensationalists it never gets mentioned in the advertising.
        Dispensationalists believe that the history of mankind from the creation
        and Adam is split up into time periods following the structure of the
        seven days of creation.&nbsp; Typically if a group believes in a young
        earth then the return of Jesus and the end of all things has to be some
        time about now(ish) – probably - hopefully (as I said lots of
        waiting).&nbsp; I am still not clear to what extent the CDs officially
        follow this view but I certainly remember mum sharing her thoughts on
        the subject with me.&nbsp; Unlike the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JWs – again
        for typing sanity), the CDs have (for the most part) resisted placing an
        actual date on Armageddon. The JWs have made a few efforts to predict
        the end of the world all obviously wrong, at which point the leadership
        whistles in the air and moves swiftly on as if it never happened. I know
        the JWs are now prone to deny the whole 1975 prophecy debacle and I have
        zero interest in debating this, the evidence is so far as I can see is
        conclusive that this was case, go look it up. <br>
        <br>
        Really though, I don’t give a shit about dispensationalist beliefs, I
        couldn’t care less about the truth or otherwise of prophecy.&nbsp; What
        I do care about is the impact crappy beliefs have on a person's mental
        and emotional health and ultimately the quality of their lives. <br>
        <br>
        I remember one day looking out of the front window in the house in
        Crewe.&nbsp; I could see people walking by who I knew were not
        believers. I must have been around seven finding it frightening to think
        that God was going to wipe them all out. There was no pleasure in this.
        <br>
        <br>
        On one hand it seemed normal as I didn't know anything else, as I have
        grown older I more clearly see the damage done. It is so hard to express
        to outsiders how utterly toxic the environment was.&nbsp; It was the
        cold war; Russians were a constant threat on the horizon the fear of
        nuclear holocaust was always alive.&nbsp; If God was to burn up the
        Earth and start anew perhaps humans would be the ones who would do his
        dirty work for him by dropping the bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as a child I
        was profoundly aware of the evils of the current age and its imminent
        destruction.&nbsp; There was little hope for the future; even God’s
        Kingdom post apocalypse didn’t seem too grand.&nbsp; The idea of an
        eternity with the CDs didn’t look much like fun from where I was
        standing. <br>
        <br>
        Add to this gloom my father.&nbsp; He was a dark figure by then.&nbsp; I
        do remember times when he was fun and would tickle me till it was agony.
        Sadly I also remember being told to leave him alone as he sat looking
        shadowy and exhausted in his chair with a mug of tea. <br>
        <br>
        We all lived in the darkness of the end times.&nbsp; Hal Lindsey’s The
        Late Great Planet Earth was, can you believe, the number one selling
        book of the 1970’s?&nbsp; Hal Lindsey didn’t opt for 1975 as the year
        for the end but reading that book on publication in 1970 would have made
        the coming decade a very gloomy prospect. <br>
        <br>
        Now factor in the 1975 prediction.&nbsp; As an adult I am in the process
        of piecing together the order of events of my early childhood.&nbsp;
        Through the eyes of that child it all seems disconnected and
        muddled.&nbsp; By drawing up a time-line I can get a better sense of
        what events happened when, and most of all how old we all were. As an
        adult I understand now more clearly the impact of bereavement,
        separation and loss, lessons my young self would soon learn. I was
        second to the youngest and my older siblings all seemed like
        grownups.&nbsp; This though was the illusion of childhood, they were not
        grownups, we were all kids and young teenagers trying to find our way in
        this pretty toxic environment. <br>
        <br>
        My dad’s brother and his wife were JWs.&nbsp; They were not fondly
        regarded by our family as they took certain actions that were
        financially beneficial to themselves resulting in my parents having to
        look after my dad’s mother. I know my parents studied with my uncle and
        aunty deciding instead to join the CDs over the JWs. I find it hard to
        believe, given the similarities of the two cults, that conversations
        were not ongoing over the coming years about their respective belief
        systems. <br>
        <br>
        So, what about 1975?&nbsp; In 1966 the announcement was made by the
        Watchtower that the world was going to end in 1975.&nbsp; Now is the
        period to prepare for the battle of Armageddon.&nbsp; Given the
        organisational structure of the JWs this announcement didn’t take long
        to make it over the Atlantic.&nbsp; A quick search on YouTube will bring
        up a 1968 BBC radio broadcast with a member of the time explaining the
        end of the world in 75. <br>
        <br>
        Members sold valuable possessions, they sold houses, they gave up jobs,
        they delayed education, couples decided not to start families and not
        undertake healthcare all in an effort to invest time and money into the
        mission of converting as many as possible during the lead up to the
        end.&nbsp; This prediction perhaps starts to shed a new light on the
        actions of my dad’s brother and his wife. <br>
        <br>
        Then there was my dad’s illness.&nbsp; There was a long lead up of other
        contributing factors, but the worst period started around 1968, ending -
        oddly enough after we moved to Congleton around guess when? 1975.&nbsp;
        Perhaps it was all just a coincidence, dad wasn't better overnight it
        took a long time, in truth he was never fully well.&nbsp; Perhaps being
        a pre-millennial dispensationalist with a JW brother between 1966 and
        1975 had no impact at all and the subject was never raised? <br>
        <br>
        But what about me?&nbsp; I had a nice school in Crewe, friends, familiar
        haunts and a familiar home.&nbsp; It seemed I came home one day and was
        suddenly transported by bus into hell. I was now in a rough estate and a
        rough school feeling like I had landed from Mars.&nbsp; I had no idea
        how to relate to the violent bully culture in the school and my parent’s
        sage advice to always “turn the other cheek” only served to make matters
        worse. Looking back now I feel in many ways that for me the world really
        had ended in 1975. </article>
