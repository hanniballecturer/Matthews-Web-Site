        <h2>Part 3 On Joining a Cult</h2>
        Could you join a cult?<br>
        <br>
        Are you the sort of person that might want something better out of life?
        Are you the sort of person who would like more money? Would you like to
        see the world changed for the better? Would you like to feel more
        spiritual and closer to the divine? Perhaps you want to be as far away
        from religion as possible? Would you just for once like to be actually
        really good at something? Is there one idea or belief that you wished
        all others shared?<br>
        <br>
        Is there something you desire?<br>
        <br>
        Did you answered yes to any of the above questions? <br>
        <br>
        Well, there is likely a cult with your name on it.<br>
        <br>
        I feel shame having been in a cult. I also feel confusion too. I was
        raised in the Christadelphians but it wasn't until I became involved in
        the International Church of Christ that I really grasped how monstrous
        cults are.<br>
        <br>
        It has taken over a decade to figure out that something deeply damaging
        had happened to me. It has taken more than a decade to open up and start
        talking about the abuse. For much of that time I have blamed myself. <br>
        <br>
        I find there is a problem though! How do I explain what happened to me
        without sounding like a complete nutter? Was I really so weak and
        pathetic to be drawn into something so damaging. <br>
        <br>
        Was I really so stupid?<br>
        <br>
        So, here goes, let's try and explain how the machine works. This was my
        experience, perhaps some of this will make sense.<br>
        First things first, nobody ever joins a cult!<br>
        <br>
        When you join a cult it never has a sign on the door saying “we are a
        cult”. If you really knew it was a cult you simply wouldn’t bother. Long
        after I joined and ultimately left I still wasn't clear that I had been
        in a cult.<br>
        <br>
        The shop window of a cult always misrepresents what is actually on sale.
        Don't bother asking the members, they cannot be honest about how they
        think and feel. They will suppress their true doubts and feelings. They
        neglect to mention their personal difficulties whilst greeting you with
        joy and charm. The inner workings of the cult e.g. finance will not be
        open to scrutiny nor will the revolving door of members joining and
        leaving. Frequently the group history is rewritten and adjusted to cover
        up past scandals and failure. "Yes, mistakes were made" and "things have
        changed" will be the mantras to outsiders. Dirty secrets remain stacked
        in every dark corner and never discussed.<br>
        <br>
        What happens when you join a cult might be something like the following.
        <br>
        <br>
        You have a leaflet/friend/family member who has a fantastic opportunity
        for faith/wealth/political change who would like to invite you to a
        meeting. When you attend the meeting everybody seems really friendly and
        knowledgeable. The leader is slick and charismatic; many of his points
        resonate with you. Some things seem a bit odd, but hey – you don’t need
        to agree with everything. Certainly what they are offering seems great
        and there are so many people with success stories. You agree to meet
        “one more time” and also go out on a social activity with your friend
        and a few of his fellow members. Everybody is really interested in you
        and they seem to be able to provide exactly the answer you are seeking.<br>
        <br>
        To capture you, the cult must connect with your desires.<br>
        <br>
        Do you desire more money? Perhaps the cult will offer a system for
        making extra cash in your spare time.<br>
        <br>
        Want to feel closer to God? A cult might catch your attention by their
        apparently reformed lives and impressive Bible knowledge.<br>
        <br>
        Feel a need to create political change? You might be impressed with the
        turnout to their rallies and meetings.<br>
        <br>
        Desires always beg the question how much is enough? How much is enough
        money, spirituality or political change? What will be sufficient to
        satisfy? Your desires become a carrot on a stick. A stick you will soon
        discover of ever increasing length. <br>
        <br>
        You may feel some sense of shame too. You have wasted all of this time
        chasing after your heart's desire and these people seem to have nailed
        it. What have you been messing about at? <br>
        <br>
        The cult makes a proposal, “we have the answer”.<br>
        <br>
        “We have the answer and we have the system to satisfy your desire. After
        all, look at the people around you who are already members. These were
        people just like you who have changed their lives by following our
        system, you can do this too." <br>
        <br>
        "Think positively, have a little faith!”<br>
        <br>
        The cult makes itself a monument to what committed people can achieve.
        This monument casts a shadow on your own efforts. Honestly, are you
        really committed? Are you really doing your best? Your unfulfilled
        desires become a weapon, a rod to beat you with shame and humiliation.
        After all, "if you were totally committed you would not need our help!"<br>
        <br>
        The offer is made more credible by coming from people you trust. It
        might be your brother, a friend or your partner. Perhaps you simply
        trust the leader of the group, they seem so genuine. Perhaps the message
        also chimes with some existing faulty belief that you didn't know you
        had.<br>
        <br>
        You take that first small step of trust.<br>
        <br>
        Then you encounter the first bait and switch.<br>
        <br>
        A door just closed behind you and you didn't even notice.<br>
        <br>
        Now they have you!<br>
        <br>
        Want to make more money? You need to start buying our products.<br>
        <br>
        Want to feel closer to God? You need to follow your Bible study leader.<br>
        <br>
        Want to change the world? You need to read more of the literature so
        that you know how to argue your case. <br>
        <br>
        What just happened is that your legitimate desire has now been
        substituted for the needs of the group.<br>
        <br>
        You will buy this tactic because you want your own needs met. You will
        buy this tactic because others lay claim to success. You will buy this
        tactic because you feel small and ashamed. You will buy this tactic
        because you feel excited about the prospect of change.<br>
        <br>
        You follow the advice regardless of common sense or instinct. There may
        be an initial hit of excitement, it feels good but soon it fades. You
        are left with a nagging sense that you are still not having your desires
        met. "Is this working?" You may feel in your heart that satisfaction is
        slipping away from you but you want another shot of the good stuff,
        perhaps that is the key?<br>
        <br>
        Then comes the next bait and switch.<br>
        <br>
        Another door closes silently behind you.<br>
        <br>
        “Yes I know how you feel at this stage, I felt the same and wondered if
        it was all worth it but I found there were still other things I needed
        to do.”<br>
        <br>
        Is there still no money coming in? Start inviting your friends and
        family to sales meetings.<br>
        <br>
        Do you still feel no closer to God? Make sure you attend all of the
        meetings, "it really helped me".<br>
        <br>
        Is the world not changing? You need to get out on the street and spread
        the message. <br>
        <br>
        Just try a bit harder, it will be worth it.<br>
        <br>
        You feel another hit. You are now on a slippery slope of following the
        cult's advice whilst waiting for lasting satisfaction. Your desperation
        becomes more profound as fulfillment becomes more elusive. <br>
        <br>
        Lies dressed as advice are never revealed all at once, you are initiated
        into the smaller lies first then graduating to the bigger ones. You
        don't even need to believe the lies with any true conviction. Ensure you
        provide the right answer when asked on questions of doctrine, shout and
        clap at the right moment in meetings, do as you are told, ignore your
        doubts and questions. <br>
        <br>
        Fake it till you make it becomes your motto, but you will call it faith.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some advising you may genuinely believe the advice or at least bits of
        it. You follow where they lead because you trust them. Your
        dissatisfaction with yourself is now even more profound. <br>
        <br>
        This now sends one very clear message, the problem is you! <br>
        <br>
        Bait and switches do not form an orderly queue. They start as a gentle
        rain and then form a torrent. This advice is supposed to satisfy your
        legitimate desire but instead it drags you deeper into the system.<br>
        <br>
        In parallel other things are happening too. <br>
        <br>
        You are now part of a culture of like minded individuals who are all
        sinking deeper into the ideological quick sand of the group. The common
        experience starts to bind you together in your shared pretense,
        determination, desperation and frustration. Some really deep friendships
        start to form.<br>
        <br>
        A second strand starts to appear too. As one bait and switch is layered
        on the other you realise that more and more time is being spent
        immersing yourself in the group. Evenings and weekends are taken up with
        meetings; money seems to fly out of your account as you “invest” in
        campaigning, travelling or tithing. <br>
        <br>
        You are though a person of limited resources, there are only so many
        hours in the week, so many pay cheques a month, and you only have so
        much tolerance for the growing mental and emotional exhaustion. With no
        time to think clearly your life is now being entirely assimilated by the
        cult. Your previous friends and family seem remote. Perhaps you have
        been advised to move on from the "dead wood" that won’t convert and
        concentrate on pastures new? Perhaps your friends and family have also
        stepped back too, perhaps they are tired of you going on at them all the
        time?<br>
        <br>
        You start to think more fully as a cult member. Your primary concerns
        become preserving the image of the group, increasing the membership and
        maintaining the flow of cash. Perhaps from time to time you gasp for
        breath and remember the desire you once had. It seems a remote and
        forgotten dream. All that matters now is supporting the cultic system
        and your fellow members.<br>
        <br>
        Leaving will now be hugely traumatic, you have invested too much, you
        would be committing an act of betrayal. Consider the cost if you have
        family members in the cult or you have married into the cult? What if
        you now have children who are members? You are painfully aware that
        those who leave the cult are held up as failures, apostates, objects of
        ridicule and isolation. You soon realise that leaving will cost you
        every significant relationship you have left. More than that, any
        condemnation of the system must equate to condemnation of yourself, you
        now have blood on your hands, you are complicit! <br>
        <br>
        Chasing the cult's way of salvation is addictive, you cannot stop. You
        feel terrified. If you let go there is nothing for you on the outside,
        only oblivion and isolation.<br>
        <br>
        The cult knows this. <br>
        <br>
        If you fail to meet the targets, sell the products, invite new members
        and do as you are told, the cult will threaten dismissal to force
        compliance. The cult may also apply mental, emotional or sexual violence
        to ensure this.<br>
        <br>
        Resist or fail to comply and you will be chewed up, spat out and lose
        everything.<br>
