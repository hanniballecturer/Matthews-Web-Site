        <h2>Out of the Frying Pan</h2>
        “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human
        face - forever.” <br>
        <br>
        George Orwell’s 1984 is a good place to start for understanding how it
        feels to be in a cult. <br>
        <br>
        Forbidden acts go on in secret, members are constantly surveilled,
        history is eternally re-written and relationships, especially sexual
        ones are strictly controlled. Orwell creates a strong sense of being
        inside looking out. The disdain for the non party members, the proles,
        reflects the attitudes cult members may have to outsiders. Lastly there
        is the strong leader figure, Big Brother, who is constantly imprinted on
        each member’s heart and mind. <br>
        <br>
        Orwell gets one thing wrong though when he comes to the process of
        thought reform or brain washing. To undergo thought reform there is no
        need to be tied to a chair or exposed to your worst nightmares in room
        101. <br>
        <br>
        The simplest mechanism for thought reform is an age old technique called
        lying. <br>
        <br>
        In this modern age lying is now seen as a valid political strategy. <br>
        <br>
        Good liars make for good cult leaders, they can make people believe any
        crap they like. <br>
        <br>
        At the very least they make you doubt yourself and the worth of your own
        values. <br>
        <br>
        Cult leaders are in my view likely to be pathological liars. They may be
        charming, charismatic, funny and speak with genuine conviction. They
        speak with great confidence about what they believe, and can be very
        persuasive. You may mistake their charm, conviction and confidence as
        truth. More often than not they are gas lighting you. When they adjust
        the truth they may imagine the truth is being adjusted to protect you.
        They imagine the truth is being released incrementally such that you
        understand each aspect "correctly". <br>
        <br>
        If you are unable to make an informed choice about what you are getting
        into then you are very likely to be mislead. Lying, deception, bending
        the truth, keeping silent about wrong doing. They all serve to provide
        false information as you trustingly cross the threshold. <br>
        <br>
        A second effective tool for thought reform is to use the people around
        you to force conformity. <br>
        <br>
        The people you trust. There is something primal about the human need to
        follow the herd. I once went to a meeting of the Jesus Army in
        Leicester. A friend of mine was doing research into forms of church
        music for their undergraduate dissertation. We entered the tent and they
        said we should sit at the front. “Why” I asked? “Because if you sit
        further back you are likely be swept up by the atmosphere in the room!”
        She was right. Even sitting where we were had a profound impact on me. I
        couldn’t sleep that night, I felt deeply unsettled by it all. For a less
        churchy experiment just try sitting sour faced on the front row of a
        comedy club or try reading a book at a large sports event. <br>
        <br>
        When we see people around us acting in a certain way it is hard not to
        follow suit. Social conformity is a powerful way of producing compliance
        especially when it comes from those we trust. Other forces may be added
        too to ensure behavioral compliance. Public or private shaming, public
        or private commendation, both may be used to inflate or deflate us as
        required. <br>
        <br>
        As we feel the mounting pressure we increasingly engage with the cultic
        system. <br>
        <br>
        Activities within the system also serve to undermine our judgement.
        Meditation or prayer can be used to instil hypnotic states that make us
        more susceptible to the “truth” of the message. The same can be true of
        the TV, cinema or internet. I often get a similar feeling watching
        adverts in the cinema. Loud music plays as a man walks on a beam of
        light through space. Car adverts mix surreal impossible images. <br>
        <br>
        They serve to create dreamlike hypnotic states. This is clearly a minor
        pressure when it comes to persuasion but consider how much is spent each
        year on advertising. <br>
        <br>
        As we sink deeper and deeper into the cult our language starts to
        change. Words that once seemed ordinary take on a new meaning not
        understood by an outsider. Each cult develops its own Orwellian Newspeak
        as the language becomes loaded. <br>
        <br>
        Eventually we become a part of the system and apply to others the same
        coercive techniques that were used on us. <br>
        <br>
        The end product of this process is the creation of phobias. Deep
        irrational fears linked with key beliefs held by the group. They seem
        crazy to any outsider but to those in the cult they have the capacity to
        invoke pure terror. <br>
        <br>
        In my story the date was 1994. <br>
        <br>
        The Birmingham Church of Christ was a 45 minute drive down the motorway.
        My wife and I had left the mainstream church in Leicester. Initially we
        traveled to Birmingham at least twice a week. <br>
        <br>
        I was already pretty damaged. I had worked so hard and achieved so
        little. Mentally and emotionally drained I really needed time and space
        to recover. <br>
        <br>
        I got that, for a little while – sort of. <br>
        <br>
        When we arrived at the first meeting an older couple latched onto us and
        we became good friends. We often stayed with them on a Saturday and ate
        Sunday lunch together after the meeting. In spite of the age gap in my
        case I felt better able to relate to them, the younger members I found
        quite irritating. <br>
        <br>
        We wanted to understand how they did it. We wanted to learn. How was it
        that the church in Leicester and the church in London, started around
        the same time could display such different patterns of growth? <br>
        <br>
        What we were yet to fully appreciate is that there was a system, a
        machine. A machine that claims it will fill you with spirituality and
        bring you closer to God. It does no such thing. Dismantle the machine
        and compare it to other cults and you find the same components serving
        similar functions. <br>
        <br>
        One core idea at the heart of this group was the idea of being a
        “disciple”. Here lay an important question. A disciple is a learner, so
        how quickly should a person learn? Should a disciple learn at their own
        speed, or should they learn quickly as dictated by external forces? <br>
        <br>
        The group took the latter option. <br>
        <br>
        A disciple was defined as somebody who is “totally committed”, “fired up
        for God”. If you were not a true disciple you were going to Hell. <br>
        <br>
        (Note the loaded language.) <br>
        <br>
        So what happens if I get up late one morning and want to take a day off
        from my morning prayer? Does that mean I fall below the standard of
        total commitment? Does that therefore make me a bad person? What if I
        refuse to learn something or disagree with a teaching? Does that make me
        rebellious? Am I a sinner? <br>
        <br>
        The answer to these questions was invariable “yes”. <br>
        <br>
        From the concept of being a disciple comes the first point of practice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Every member of the group had to have a mentor called a discipler. A
        discipler was allocated over you to provide friendship and support; at
        least that is the theory. The discipling system forms a pyramid. Each
        person has another member over them and this reaches all the way to the
        top of the organisation. <br>
        <br>
        Upon first arriving we were allocated the preacher and his wife to
        "disciple" us. <br>
        <br>
        Any instruction given to you by your discipler was referred to as
        “advice” (more loaded language). It soon started to become clear that
        saying no was never an acceptable response to “advice”. If you were
        genuinely committed and had faith you must always answer in the
        affirmative. <br>
        <br>
        I was still looking for work at this point in time. My typical day
        involved looking at job sites and going through the papers. Then the
        tedium would kick in. To alleviate this I would walk down to the local
        video shop. During the day they had a deal where you could rent six
        videos for a couple of quid. Mostly I ended up ploughing through the
        complete works of Jean-Claude Van Damme along with other cinema
        classics. In many ways my day was boring and exhausting but it did give
        me a dose of quality time with myself, something I always appreciate to
        re-charge my batteries and work out which way was up. <br>
        <br>
        The preacher did not approve. Cults don’t like you disconnecting
        yourself from the group. Staying close to the pack is the best strategy
        for maintaining control. I didn’t have the strength or the inclination
        to disagree. His “advice”? I should drive over to Birmingham each day.
        This would be an opportunity to meet with the “brothers”. This is not
        brother in the sense of a monastic order, not brother in the sense of a
        trade union, it felt more like brother in the sense of some rap video,
        often shortened to bro’. <br>
        <br>
        Each day I would travel to Birmingham. There was a great deal of talk
        about commitment. Anything perceived as a half measure was frowned upon.
        You had to be prepared to do whatever it takes to prove your commitment
        to the Lord. There would be long conversations about how you had to
        submit to your discipler in order to demonstrate what a "good heart" you
        had. I often talked to people with deep feelings of guilt and shame from
        simply wanting to assert their own identities. <br>
        <br>
        Part of this commitment requires being completely submissive. <br>
        <br>
        Given my upbringing to turn the other cheek I was pretty good at this! <br>
        <br>
        Your discipler has been placed over you in a position of authority by
        the church. This authority obviously comes from God. This authority must
        therefore be obeyed or suffer the consequences. It was often unspoken
        but there was always a sense that something very bad could happen to you
        should you resist “advice”. <br>
        <br>
        In one meeting for married couples it was announced that husbands have
        total authority over their wives and she must obey him even when he is
        wrong. Failure to obey your husband is failure to obey God. This was
        very much an extension of the authoritarian nature of the wider
        discipling system. <br>
        <br>
        One day I was chatting to a “brother” and he asked how my job hunting
        was going, “not well I said”. He came up with the idea that I should
        offer my services for free, become a sort of intern. It wasn’t that bad
        an idea we had enough money coming in so it was a viable option. <br>
        <br>
        I wrote to a load of local companies and within a few weeks I was
        offered a job at a local software house. The did agree to pay me too. <br>
        <br>
        This brought the daily trips to Birmingham to an end. <br>
        <br>
        The heart of the machine is discipling. <br>
        <br>
        The fires of Hell fuel the machine. <br>
        <br>
        The church would argue that the single function of being a Christian is
        to reach out to the lost. <br>
        <br>
        If Hell is real and we have the means to save people then how selfish
        are you to keep the message to yourself? <br>
        <br>
        "I don’t care if you don’t like talking to people, 'repent' and preach
        the word." <br>
        <br>
        "Do you feel tired? It doesn’t matter, what about those people you have
        to reach? They are going to burn." <br>
        <br>
        "Missions need money too. Holding back your finances is selfish when
        there is a world to save." <br>
        <br>
        Any form of resistance is “sin”. You know where sin gets you? "Repent."
        <br>
        <br>
        The church had a mission. That mission was to spread the "gospel" to the
        entire planet in a single generation. By the gospel I mean the gospel as
        defined by the ICC. Keep in mind they believe that every other church is
        wrong and are all going directly to Hell. <br>
        <br>
        We have now added into the mix an alarming sense of urgency. <br>
        <br>
        The pressure was overwhelming. <br>
        <br>
        We were now a permanent fixture in Leicester. So the "advice" was that
        we needed to be bringing visitors from Leicester over to Birmingham
        every Sunday. There was one other member living locally and most nights
        after work we would meet at the clock tower and invite people to the
        meetings. <br>
        <br>
        I conformed because everybody else conformed. <br>
        <br>
        It was quite surprising how many people we managed to interest. <br>
        <br>
        Another matter the group was very interested in was how much money we
        donated in contribution. We were “encouraged” to give ten percent of our
        earnings; ten percent of gross that is. This wasn’t the end of the
        matter though; there were also special contributions that had to be made
        at other times too. This was on top of the ten percent you were already
        giving. "This was a sacrifice demonstrating your true commitment to the
        Lord". There were cases of members signing up as medical guinea pigs for
        cash. The money raised was donated directly to the church. <br>
        <br>
        How would they know what a person did or didn’t do with their own money?
        <br>
        <br>
        Like Orwell’s book there was surveillance. <br>
        <br>
        Another function of a discipler is to police the person they are
        discipling. <br>
        <br>
        Six months in we were no longer being discipled by the preachers but by
        members further down the pyramid. They were fine as people but above
        them were a couple who were serious true believers who took little truck
        with any perceived lack of commitment. Those discipling the two of us
        clearly felt bullied and they passed that stress down the chain of
        command. <br>
        <br>
        Every day there would be a phone call with my discipler. Then the
        intrusive questions would start. You had to be “open” and “vulnerable”
        to show you had a “good heart”. Disciplers would keep track of how much
        you contributed, how often you attended, who you were bringing to
        meetings. Start to slip in any of these areas and the questions would
        become tense and awkward. You knew your commitment was coming into
        question. Did you reach out to somebody today? Did you have your “quiet
        time” and get up early to pray? Did you read your Bible? Single men
        would be asked if they masturbated due to impure thoughts. Married
        couples would be asked about their sex life. Resistance was futile.
        "Advice" would cover such things as what to do with your time in the
        week, when to take a holiday, who to date, who to marry and where to
        work. <br>
        <br>
        One final question. “Are you fired up?” <br>
        <br>
        It wasn't good enought to simply obey, you had to do it with a smile on
        your face. You had to be excited, you had to sing with all your heart,
        pray as loud as you can, clap and shout in all the right places. By this
        process joy and enthusiasm are artificially synthesised even though you
        might feel dead and empty inside. <br>
        <br>
        When everybody got the message there was a loud “amen!” <br>
        <br>
        They were always chasing the perfect guilt trip within you. <br>
        <br>
        By reaching this point you could be coerced into conformity and
        obedience. If there were no obvious sins to latch onto they could be
        invented. Old sins would be dragged from the past to remind you just how
        crap you really are. <br>
        <br>
        Unconditional love of any sort, was completely off the menu. <br>
        <br>
        Values of any real importance became lost in a cacophony of fear and
        obedience. <br>
        <br>
        I did say "no" on one occasion. It was a tiny victory though. We were on
        holiday in Cornwall and my wife’s brother and brother in law were being
        appointed as elders in the London Church. The “advice” was that we
        “should try to be there”, so we drove all the way from Cornwall to
        London to attend the meeting on a Sunday. At the end of the meeting one
        of the leaders told us that we should cut short our holiday by a week
        and come back home. I said no. The look on her face was like I had taken
        a huge shit on her carpet. Make a habit of refusal and you start to hit
        problems. <br>
        <br>
        Firstly you might find yourself involved in a breaking session. <br>
        <br>
        You might find yourself in a room with other members and they will rip
        into you in order to break your will. I never found myself on the
        receiving end of such a session but there was a moment where I came
        close. I did know people who experienced this and talk of such sessions
        was common. <br>
        <br>
        Secondly you may just find yourself placed under so much pressure by
        your discipler that you are simply forced to leave. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally there were the purges. From time to time there had been a
        purge of members who were not sufficiently committed. Breaking sessions
        and pressure from disciplers would be used to clear out the dead wood. <br>
        <br>
        The end point was to force further conformity or your ejection from the
        group. The latter option would result in disconnection from everybody
        you know and care for. <br>
        <br>
        These brutal tools had power beyond even their implementation. They were
        waved around as a potential punishment for disobedience, often spoken in
        whispers. Even these whispers helped to keep members in line. Such
        threats were used like severed heads on a castle wall, a warning to the
        disobedient. <br>
        <br>
        People were reluctant to test the system too far. They knew the risks as
        they would feel like they were betraying God as well as the group! <br>
        <br>
        By now the inevitable phobias were well developed in me. There was a
        deep irrational terror of life on the outside. Leaving meant automatic
        entry into the flames of Hell and the loss of all I held dear. I didn't
        feel like I had sins, I felt like I was sin. Sin to the very core of my
        being, an utterly revolting person. <br>
        <br>
        You were strongly encouraged to confess sins to your discipler. Whatever
        you said was not private to you and your discipler. Words said in
        private and actions done in public were passed up the pyramid. The
        people in charge knew who was doing what. <br>
        <br>
        All of this information travelling up the system formed statistics or
        rather “the stats”. “The stats” were used to assess and judge the
        spiritual health of an individual, a study group, an entire church, even
        the whole movement. <br>
        <br>
        An Excel spreadsheet sat in the judgement seat of God. <br>
        <br>
        It held information on the number of visitors, the number of baptisms
        and the amount of contribution. <br>
        <br>
        “Bow down and worship the great and mighty stats”. <br>
        <br>
        What about the Bible? Like other previous groups the Bible is used as a
        proof text to justify the churches already established policies and
        procedures. The members learn a tiny subset of passages really well but
        with no context or academic rigor. The Bible was used as a weapon to
        bludgeon existing members and potential converts into compliance. <br>
        <br>
        At the core of their beliefs was a profound and merciless pragmatism.
        Practice must be true because it gets results, the end justifies the
        means.<br>
        <br>
        Anybody who gets in the way is simply collateral damage. <br>
        <br>
        Over a period of about six months the kid’s gloves were off and we were
        set to work. Compliance was the only acceptable option. Meeting the
        impossible target of saving the world was the only priority. <br>
        <br>
        Forget your needs, forget your wants, forget your desires, they no
        longer matter. Pick up your cross and walk in the footsteps of Jesus. <br>
        <br>
        "He who gains his life will lose it; he who loses his life will find
        it." <br>
        <br>
        I had started from a low point when I arrived; the only way from here
        was down. <br>
        <br>
        There was a slow and steady decent into bitter darkness. <br>
        <br>
        I also knew this was bullshit. <br>
        <br>
        The tipping point came on a Wednesday not long after my birthday. I had
        recently met a chap from Mexico. I was advised to arrange a Bible study
        with him as soon as possible. <br>
        <br>
        “Why not do it tonight after the Wednesday meeting?” <br>
        <br>
        It wasn't really a question, nor was the motive pure. <br>
        <br>
        By rushing the study through it would make it onto this weeks stats
        report. <br>
        <br>
        “I don’t doubt your commitment Matthew.” <br>
        <br>
        I did a full day at work, drove to Birmingham and back to Leicester. It
        was gone 10pm by the time we met for the Bible study, midnight by the
        time I was home. <br>
        <br>
        I was so tired. <br>
        <br>
        The next day I started with a bad cold. I telephoned into work sick. <br>
        <br>
        The cold refused to lift. I felt terrible so went to see the GP.
        Immediately I was signed off with severe depression. <br>
        <br>
        It was the start of six years sitting in a dark pit. </article>
