        <h2>Part 6 The Last Song</h2>
        When I was a child, the Christadelphian Sunday school teacher would ask
        me to sing. She would lift me up onto the table. From there I would sing
        to the class. She always told mum that I had a lovely singing voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        That was the first time I remember singing in any sort of church
        context.
        <br>
        <br>
        Jump ahead to 1994. I suppose it was inevitable that I would end up
        leading the singing at my new church.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the last eight years I had been happy, life was good. I had married
        in 1986. My wife was twenty years my senior and as a result got a huge
        amount of agro from her family and the church. The preacher’s wife told
        her “I wish there was something in the Bible against this age gap. I
        have looked and found nothing.” Such was their kindness of spirit. It
        illustrates too their authoritarianism and legalism.
        <br>
        <br>
        The girl I became so besotted with whilst studying was now married. We
        were all really good friends. She and her husband were best man and
        bridesmaid at our wedding. <br>
        <br>
        Yes we were happy but a storm was coming.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having completed my Biology HND I was done with education. For quite a
        long time I messed around in rubbish jobs. I tried selling fax machines
        to local businesses long before anybody had even heard of them; I didn’t
        make a single sale. Then I started working in a lighting showroom
        frequented by well to do clients. One time Mr Shonki the local estate
        agent came into the shop. He wanted to buy a thousand pound chandelier
        cash with significant discount. His argument was that he had seen it
        cheaper elsewhere, so I told him he should go there and buy it. He
        complained to my boss and I got a bollocking. I didn’t know or care who
        he was! After a year at the lighting showroom I tried setting up my own
        business making and selling jingles to hospital radio. It was with a
        friend at church and was a complete disaster. After a few months of
        unemployment I applied for and got a job at the East Midlands
        Electricity shop in town. I stuck it out for five years. One of my
        supervisors commented “Matthew was always happy with the work until we
        let the customers in at 9am!” <br>
        <br>
        There had to be more to employment than this! A friend told me that he
        had started an MSc in Computing. Being a conversion course they didn’t
        expect any prior knowledge so the Biology wasn’t a problem. The fact
        that I only had an HND was potentially an issue. I applied and made the
        case that I was a self taught programmer with years of experience. They
        accepted me. The course was hard. It was a three year degree compressed
        into twelve months of study. Some of my fellow students looked grey with
        the pressure. The volume of work was tough but mostly I could cope with
        the level. The skills acquired since owning my ZX80 had stood my in good
        stead. Perhaps there was money to be made in computers after all!
        <br>
        <br>
        I had become quite insular as a result of my church membership. One day
        at the lighting showroom a member of staff kept singing some song about
        giving up and letting down. I asked him “who is that?” “Rick Astley” he
        replied, “only the current number one”. I felt profoundly out of touch.
        The MSc had a similar impact. Conversations with fellow students began
        to challenge the "truth" I was taught at church, something was starting
        to crumble.
        <br>
        <br>
        That brings me to the church.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was very much the central focus for our marriage. Given the coming
        storm it would also be our end.
        <br>
        <br>
        I once had a dream. In the dream I was in a Bible study and there were
        about half a dozen people there. We were all served drinks in tumblers.
        The glasses contained orange squash but there was a problem. Each glass
        had been topped up to the brim with just syrup, there was no water. The
        first person drank theirs and said it was lovely. The second person
        drank and made appropriate sounds of appreciation. Then it was my turn.
        I drank. It was sweet and thick on my tongue, revolting. Rather than
        telling the truth I said it was great. To fit in I ignored my better
        judgement. <br>
        <br>
        Something about the dream chilled me, it signposted my growing sense of
        disillusionment.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was also a second incident that troubled me.
        <br>
        <br>
        A new family was attending the church. I got to know them quite well. On
        one occasion the husband said something that had an impact on me. “You
        are wrong in what you are doing!” he said. “You invite people to your
        church which I understand, but you are inviting them into a spiritual
        vacuum.” I pondered this; Jesus once said something similar of the
        Pharisees. He criticised them for being white washed tombs full of dead
        men’s bones, beautiful on the outside but full of death and decay on the
        inside. This church was the same.
        <br>
        <br>
        The deeper I got, the more I tasted the vacuum.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then there was the shadow of the International Church of Christ or ICC.
        <br>
        <br>
        My wife’s sister and husband had called it a day on the “traditional”
        Church of Christ and jumped ship to the London Church of Christ newly
        founded by the ICC. They were living in Corby at the time. They sold up
        and moved to London. This decision sent shock waves through the
        traditional churches. We felt the shock waves most. Not only was this a
        defection of high level members from long standing families in the
        church it was a defection of direct family members. Every time we met
        them they would go on about how great it all was. As with any cult it
        was impossible to make any sense of the inside from the outside. I
        looked at their doctrines and couldn’t tell much difference between them
        and us. The simple truth was that they were growing, we were not. They
        were committed and progressive we were lukewarm.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first year of our marriage we were pretty broke. The London Church
        had a summer missionary campaign so we decided to go and stay with my
        wife’s sister and husband in London to see what all the fuss was about.
        <br>
        <br>
        We slept in the back room, a single bed with one of us on the floor. I
        have some recollections of specific events but the strongest memory is
        the intensity of the campaign. It was a rollercoaster. There was never a
        moment of time to ourselves. If we were not at some meeting we were
        inviting or talking. Members were expected to use every moment of time
        to reach out to "the lost". <br>
        <br>
        Their logic was simple and brutal.
        <br>
        <br>
        "If you claim to be a Christian with even the most basic concept of
        eternal damnation, then there is no place for a complacency."
        <br>
        <br>
        "Do you believe that millions of people are going to Hell every day? Do
        you believe that Jesus has given you the message of salvation to save
        these people? If you answer yes to both questions, then you better do
        something about it. Any other position makes you an evil, selfish,
        faithless charlatan."<br>
        <br>
        "Repent, get committed, do all that you can in your power to save a
        doomed world."
        <br>
        <br>
        The theology of the traditional churches and the ICC were so close, as
        an outsider you are hard pushed to tell the difference. Both groups
        believe in eternal conscious torment in hell, both groups agree on the
        need to evangelise the world, both groups agree that the moment of
        salvation is when an adult penitent believer is fully immersed in
        baptism. It is very hard for a member of the traditional church to form
        a credible defence against accusations of complacency from this
        position. It is hard for most mainstream Christians to find a leg to
        stand on too!
        <br>
        <br>
        It seemed to work too! On a good day in Leicester we might muster around
        20 members on a Sunday. The church had been in place for a similar
        length of time to the London Church of Christ. On a good day for the ICC
        congregation it was counted in the hundreds and heading to a thousand
        members. <br>
        <br>
        When we were at their home all we talked about was the church. Many of
        their points deeply resonated with me. They were provocative and direct.
        When we travelled by tube to a meeting we were expected to hand out
        invites to strangers on the train. When walking between venues we were
        to invite people. We attended meetings of ten or twenty, we attended
        meetings of hundreds. The torrent of activity, sensory input, lack of
        sleep and constant questioning by ICC members kept us off balance. There
        was no place for complacency. If I genuinely believed I must share the
        gospel of salvation to a population pouring into the lake of hell fire.
        I needed to act now!
        <br>
        <br>
        They didn’t just have the bums on seats, they also had the baptisms.
        After all, if baptism is the point at which a person is saved (which is
        what they believe) then counting baptisms is all that really matters.
        Since the Leicester church started I was one of a handful of baptisms.
        In that same time the London Church had baptised hundreds. We were
        clearly doing something wrong and given the imperative of "saving the
        world" it was time for things to change.
        <br>
        <br>
        The whole visit placed us in a of state of shock. <br>
        <br>
        We were told we should sell up and move down to London. <br>
        <br>
        We declined the offer.
        <br>
        <br>
        What to do though? Clearly they had something we didn’t. What was it?
        Could we replicate this within our tiny church in Leicester? That would
        be the plan. We would take what we could by way of knowledge and
        resources and try and do something similar.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then came the final cloud!
        <br>
        <br>
        We had agreed that my wife’s mother would move in with us after she had
        returned from America. We all got on really well and we had an extension
        built on the house as a granny flat. What we hadn’t counted on was her
        being diagnosed with lung cancer. She was a vegetarian most of her life,
        never drank and never smoked. One simple truth. Something will get us
        all in the end! I think it was a year or so nursing her. She died at
        home one night and we were both by her bedside at the end. I don’t feel
        we ever really grieved properly. There was a weekend away and then back
        to life as normal.
        <br>
        <br>
        We felt battered and bruised.The local Church was in a state of
        guerrilla warfare. The preachers seemed far more interest in pedantic
        biblical accuracy than actually trying to reach out to the world around
        them. It was constant passive aggressive warfare between us and others
        trying to promote change and constant resistance from the leadership.
        There were also other factions within the group such that any form of
        agreement was impossible to achieve. People would threaten to leave if
        they didn’t get their own way; there was bullying and emotional
        blackmail. Something had to give and one day it did, the preachers
        announced that they were both leaving. In retrospect I am not surprised
        but it landed me at the front of a very short queue.
        <br>
        <br>
        By this time the London Church had started a new group in Birmingham. We
        were in touch with the leadership and occasionally went to the meetings.
        It seemed a bit more user friendly than the super massive London church.
        My wife's brother and family had also jumped ship too, the were now
        attanding the ICC Manchester Church of Christ.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had completed my MSc and was looking for a job with very little luck.
        The big problem with unemployment is that it is exhausting. For a very
        brief period I did some part-time teaching at the local University. <br>
        <br>
        Given the gap in leadership at the Leicester church I took on the
        mantle. I felt woefully inadequate for the task. I kept telling myself I
        would rise to the challenge but the only thing rising was my stress
        level.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then one day a family got upset with how things were being done, they
        left. There were harsh recriminations. I didn’t have a clue how to
        handle the rising tide of conflict. The preachers hadn’t resolved any of
        the issues in the group they had ignored and suppressed them. The pot
        was now starting to boil over as long held shitty attitudes turned into
        hostility. There was no unity. I was working fifty hours a week
        preparing sermons and Bible classes. I was working flat out trying to
        keep things going whilst also looking for a job. This was insane.
        <br>
        <br>
        I tried to cope but couldn’t.<br>
        <br>
        The day had finally come for my last song at that church. <br>
        <br>
        It was my turn to lead the singing but this day was different. <br>
        <br>
        I stood up to sing, everything was in key but I couldn’t stop shaking. A
        good friend noticed this and when I sat down they approached me wanting
        to know what was wrong. I was a mess, stressed to bits, approaching
        burnout.
        <br>
        <br>
        As my friend spoke something inside me collapsed.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was nothing more to do here. We decided to join the International
        Church of Christ in Birmingham. </article>
