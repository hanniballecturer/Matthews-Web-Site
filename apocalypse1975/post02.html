        <h2>Part 2 Turning the Other Cheek</h2>
        The world had ended, I was now doomed to live in post apocalyptic
        wastelands. It was also the start of an eternal childhood summer
        holiday, there was seemingly an endless pause before starting my new
        school.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of the gloom of earlier years was lifting, but there were changes
        in the wind. We now lived in a two story flat above a shop. Older
        siblings were growing up and leaving.
        <br>
        <br>
        I suppose we lived in quite a good area in Crewe, we did after all buy
        the house for a thousand pounds. In school there I don’t recall having
        to fight! After infants school I moved to a newly built school. It was
        modern and I remember being very happy there. The children were friendly
        and the teachers were positive and nurturing. The most terrifying event
        I recall was going out of the wrong door at lunch time and having to
        walk for what seemed like ages to get to the playground. I look back on
        those times with some warmth.
        <br>
        <br>
        All that was gone now, there was a new terrain to navigate. The family
        had relocated, in part to rehabilitate my dad after his illness. We were
        also escaping the Christadelphian meeting house. Dad's illness had
        resulted in him no longer attending. Rather than responding with the
        compassion one might expect from a supposedly Christian group, pressure
        was applied to either attend or be thrown out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember that bus ride from Crewe to Congleton wondering what was
        going on, I really didn’t understand, Congleton seemed like the other
        side of the earth.
        <br>
        <br>
        I do remember it feeling awkward to fit in with the children around the
        estate. In part it was me, I had no idea how to behave with these kids,
        I know at times I was deliberately obtuse. A bigger part of it was them
        though, they were so violent and aggressive.
        <br>
        <br>
        Open arriving at the new school, I was horrified by the difference in
        culture. Fighting was verging on some sort of currency, with a pecking
        order in place.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was a term used, “the cock”. The “cock” was the biggest hardest
        thug in a given domain. There was a “cock” for each year and there was
        an alleged “cock of the school”. The “cock” was simply the boy who could
        defeat everybody else in a fight. The fighting seemed almost
        systematised. There were constant challenges to the title, constant
        posturing and jockeying for pole position. The teachers were not much
        better. They seemed to have a certain talent for meanness of spirit and
        a sharpness of tongue.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember very few specific incidents of violence. They happened, but
        the prime focus was on ritual humiliation. I was sent to school in
        shorts FFS! Just add a flat cap to complete the look of an escapee from
        the work house!
        <br>
        <br>
        In retrospect I am not sure which was more damaging; the environment
        into which I was plunged, or the advice I was given. I must have told my
        parents about how unhappy I was otherwise they would not have offered
        their wisdom. “It was wrong to fight back”, “two wrongs don’t make a
        right” and always remember the words of Jesus, to “turn the other
        cheek”. I find this is common advice from Christadelphians in response
        to conflict, violence and abuse.
        <br>
        <br>
        The fight or flight response is both normal and healthy and part of what
        keeps us safe from danger. This advice didn’t do anything to address the
        cruelty of my classmates, the danger still remained. It undermined my
        fight response leaving me with only one option, that of flight. I
        stopped going to school. Most of my junior school education and a year
        of my senior school were missed; I was too scared to go!
        <br>
        <br>
        In truth though, I quite liked being at home all of the time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The school did give me work to do, which at times I did, but mostly I
        did my own thing, building experiments, writing, drawing, watching
        educational programs on the TV. I hated playing out. The children at the
        school could no longer get at me in the school yard, when they met me in
        the street they seemed even more nasty.
        <br>
        <br>
        My first encounter with "counselling" took place during that era too. I
        was sent to a child psychologist to try and work out what was wrong with
        me. It now seems blindingly obvious what was wrong, I was a child trying
        to make sense of this mess, and the problem was never me!
        <br>
        <br>
        In time the school system lost its patience. I was told in no uncertain
        terms that I had to start going to school or I would be put into care.
        This scared the crap out of me and was a massive incentive to attend
        school.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was a bumpy start, I was so far behind in my work. I was in senior
        school by now. This was another rough school with fights every break
        time. The same bunch of thugs from junior school had followed me here.
        It wasn’t quite the same though. I was streamed with boys from other
        schools who were easier to relate to. Mostly the thugs were kept well
        away from me; sometimes you would see them dragging their knuckles on
        the floor as they slope off to classes on drain digging or some such.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes the school started as a rough school with a bad reputation, but with
        the installation of a new Head, the strategic retirement of “certain”
        teachers and the employment of teachers who wanted to actually teach,
        the school became a really positive place.
        <br>
        <br>
        Two things happened, the threat level decreased and at some point I went
        against the eleventh commandment “thou shalt not fight back”.
        <br>
        <br>
        It came as quite a shock to some of the thugs when I kicked the crap out
        of them. I didn’t need to do it that too often to gain a reputation.
        After all, what better way to make a “cock” look like a "total cock"
        than them being beaten up by me? I found that fighting back was
        empowering and something I could do if required. This new assertive me
        was able to perform at school sports, get top grades and gain the
        support of my peers.
        <br>
        <br>
        I still remember one day walking down the street wearing my Dr Martin
        boots and sage green Parka jacket feeling really good about myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then one day somebody told me I was "cock" of the year.
        <br>
        <br>
        Suddenly I felt I had overcompensated, becoming verbally and physically
        aggressive. I was full of hormones, I hit puberty ahead of my peers, and
        coupled with my added height it gave me an added edge. Then the
        religious guilt kicked in. “If this is what it means to be assertive
        then perhaps it is better to turn the other cheek”. I had no proper
        concept of assertiveness, I didn’t realise that there was a third way
        between aggression and compliance.
        <br>
        <br>
        And then my dad died.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was 13.
        <br>
        <br>
        And then there was anger and shame.
        <br>
        <br>
        I felt I was acting independently of my family and God. I felt I was
        becoming exactly the type of person I hated. Grieving, guilty and
        isolated, passivity seemed better than aggression, the threat level
        started to rise again and once more I was easy prey.
        <br>
        <br>
        And then came depression.
        <br>
        <br>
        I felt angry, defenceless and vulnerable. I was also covered in spots
        and was now failing in a new competitive arena related to girls. I lost
        interest in my A levels and withdrew into computers and guitars as my
        flight response came to the fore again.
        <br>
        <br>
        The end of the world had a massive impact, but in some ways "turn the
        other cheek" had a much greater one. </article>
