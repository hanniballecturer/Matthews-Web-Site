        <h2>Bang!</h2>
        I awoke in a stranger’s bed. She lay beside me asleep. My head was
        pounding and my mouth was bone dry. An ash tray had been knocked over
        onto the sheets; they stank of alcohol sweat and cigarettes. As my eyes
        started to focus I found myself surrounded by cuddly toys. The walls
        were covered with posters of Daniel O'Donnell. It is funny the weird
        details that stay in your recollections, especially at a time of crisis.
        In my head four words were on permanent loop “I don’t care anymore!”
        <br>
        <br>
        I had just exploded a stack of dynamite under my life!
        <br>
        <br>
        There was nothing heroic here, nothing noble, there was no great plan.
        Desperate measures were all I had left. I felt like I had been fired
        from a canon, thrown clear by a blast. The only problem with this sort
        of escape is that it both the blast and the subsequent impact on landing
        are unlikely to leave you in a good state of health. It was inevitably
        going to leave plenty of other casualties too.
        <br>
        <br>
        Within days I opened the Leicester Mercury and started to browse through
        the adverts for accommodation. I rang one number, no reply. I rang a
        second number for a flat “off the Narborough Road”, they picked up and
        we arranged a viewing the following day. I wasn’t quite clear though
        what “off the Narborough Road” actually meant, so I decided to drive
        over and take a look. The flat was above a chip shop in a really rough
        area, it was clearly a shit hole miles from town. Worse still, it was an
        expensive shit hole. I picked up the phone to cancel the appointment and
        accidently rang the first number I tried. This time they picked up.
        “Could I come in that afternoon?”
        <br>
        <br>
        It was a block of flats in the city centre; about five minutes walk from
        work. We looked at a few options that were pretty basic. The lady
        guiding me around said there was one last option available. It was a
        beautiful fully furnished one bedroom top floor apartment. There was a
        mezzanine area and a spiral staircase. I always wanted a spiral
        staircase. It was expensive but in theory within budget. <br>
        <br>
        I started to do the sums. Shit there was a massive shortfall, how could
        I afford to do this? The blood drained from my face, then I realised I
        had put the rent on the spreadsheet twice.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was a problem though; it wouldn’t be available for me to move in
        for four week. I was now technically homeless.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were friends around me, not part of the cult. They played such an
        important role at this time. For the next four weeks I sofa surfed and
        slept in spare rooms so as not to annoy any one person for too long. I
        feel a huge debt of gratitude for their kindness.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was no lift in the place so a friend and I carried what
        possessions I had up the many flights of stairs. There was a bookshelf,
        a computer and I seem to remember a wooden spoon. Most of my life
        consisted of a couple of guitars, CDs, DVD and a few books.
        <br>
        <br>
        Material possessions suddenly seemed rather unimportant. I had a roof
        over my head, a bed to sleep in and most of all I was free.
        <br>
        <br>
        But what does freedom mean to a person who has had their freedoms
        systematically stripped away?
        <br>
        <br>
        When I called it a day on the Christadelphians as a teenager I refused
        to attend the meetings and did my own thing. On a practical level I was
        free but inside I was anything but free. Their ideas and beliefs had
        taken root in my mind like bind weed. I lacked the social skills and
        appropriate world views to cope with life on the outside. When life
        became hard as I grieved the death of my father I had little to fall
        back on other than magical thinking and religious guilt. What I was
        going through was surely my own fault as I was the one who had betrayed
        both God and my parents.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was now trying to leave this unhealthy world of spiritual and cultic
        abuse for a second time. At one point I was reading the suicide notes of
        Virginia Wolfe to cheer myself up, this was not a good sign.
        <br>
        <br>
        I really thought this was it. My life was over.
        <br>
        <br>
        I sat in a nearby pub one lunch time and absolutely couldn’t imagine
        what my life might be like from this point on. I had my job and that
        felt pretty much like it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was now free and could do whatever I liked but with too many options I
        was stuck.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started going out at night, something I didn’t do in my other life. I
        watched people and felt like an outsider. I was fascinated by the queues
        outside of different night clubs, did I have the courage to go in and
        see what it was like? One night I did. I remember sitting in Lloyd’s
        Number One Bar under the stairs feeling so small and alien. For context
        who those who may not know Lloyd’s, it is not exactly the Ritz. I looked
        at the people dancing; they all seemed so cool and together. Over the
        years I use this experience as a bench mark of how far I have come. From
        time to time I sit in the same place looking at the crowds and think
        “God this place is terrible”.
        <br>
        <br>
        My friends were all telling me that I should now have some fun. Enjoy
        life a little, get out and date a bit, nothing too serious. The problem
        with real freedom is that it is terrifying. So what did I do? I became
        involved in a pretty serious relationship. But that is story outside of
        this one.
        <br>
        <br>
        I made a mistake, but the point is that it was my mistake. If freedom
        means anything then it must mean that we are allowed to make our own
        mistakes. This was not some mistake foisted upon me by an outside force
        it was 100% my own cock up.
        <br>
        <br>
        Making so many changes in my life placed me into survival mode. There
        were so many practical matters to sort out both good and bad. Many
        things other people take for granted, insurance, and banking
        arrangements. Given I didn’t own a car I had to figure out ways of
        getting about the country. One Christmas I drove to the family Christmas
        party with a hire car. I remember passing the speed camera and seeing
        the flash in my rear view mirror. There was a run of other issues that
        came in at the same time. I distinctly recall thinking that God was
        punishing me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I didn’t care anymore. The fear of Hell fire had kept me in the cult
        well beyond my sell-by date. I had finally concluded that going to Hell
        was infinitely more preferable than spending another moment in that
        shitty group.
        <br>
        <br>
        Freedom was not simply freedom to make my own mistakes it required
        something deeper. I had to set about clearing out all of the crap in my
        head that shitty religion had placed there.
        <br>
        <br>
        There was practical crap, emotional crap, mental crap and also
        relational crap.
        <br>
        <br>
        Relationships were a concern. There was period of people from the ICC
        still trying to be in touch. In some cases this was fine in other cases
        I viewed the efforts with suspicion. Certain friends and family made a
        genuine effort to stay in touch. I believe that they were showing
        genuine concern. Other people seemed far more interested in finding a
        salve for their own conscience. A few people in leadership wanted to
        meet to meet to “apologise”. “To what end?” I asked myself. I declined
        the offer deciding that keeping a wide birth was a much safer bet. They
        can stick their apologies up their arses. There were also plenty of
        people who dropped me like a stone. Many years later I want to
        Birmingham for the first time. I was still deeply apprehensive about
        bumping into somebody from the cult.
        <br>
        <br>
        Just prior to my sofa surfing, when I was reading the suicide letters of
        Virginia Wolfe I reached out to a friend from church. In fairness he
        drove over from Birmingham that night to see me. He kept telling me that
        it was down to me to decide what I wanted to do. Clearly I chose to
        leave and call it a day but I couldn’t help but feel that he was glad to
        see the back of me.
        <br>
        <br>
        As with any breakup there is also the inevitable choosing of sides that
        takes place among long standing friends. The ones that hurt the most
        were those outside of the group. They picked a side based on what
        limited information they had to hand. Given the manner of my departure
        and the fact that I wasn’t either able or willing to provide further
        context to the long and painful history leading up to the event it was
        hardly surprising. <br>
        <br>
        A couple of years ago I took on an allotment. It has proved to be
        powerful tool for healing and also a metaphor for cult recovery.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had received an email from the Council telling me that my application
        was successful. I replied stating that I was willing to take the plot
        on. The lady at the Council replied “have you seen the plot?” “No” I
        responded. This sounded ominous. I popped over to take a look, the plot
        was 11b. I found plot 11. Next door was six foot of weeds. I kept
        walking, plot 12! There was a couple working on plot 11. I asked if they
        knew which section was plot 11b. He shrugged and looked annoyed.
        “There”, directing me with a nod of his head pointing at the six foot of
        weeds. There was something about the plot that I could relate to. It had
        suffered neglect for many years and just needed some time and some TLC.
        Not afraid of a bit of hard work I took the plot on. There have been
        many times when digging the soil dragging out weeds and seeing the crops
        start to develop how similar my own healing process has been.
        <br>
        <br>
        So I bagged the lot, God, church and the Bible. To some extent I bagged
        the morality that had been sold to me from the back of a lorry. I
        chucked it all in the bin, my faith and relationships in the church. All
        abandoned, the hymns the prayers, sod it all. I was angry and I was done
        with this shit.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wanted to party, I wanted to explore other relationships I wanted to
        see the world. I made more choices, some good some bad. I travelled to
        Thailand and Australia.
        <br>
        <br>
        One day a friend of mine asked for my help. <br>
        <br>
        Her husband had died and there was a problem in the garden shed. He kept
        a fridge in the shed full of meat. The problem was that the fridge was
        faulty; it had been there for “some time now”.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not really understanding what I was getting into I offered to help clear
        it out.
        <br>
        <br>
        In some sections the meat was still frozen solid, that was the easy bit.
        In other sections the meat had become rotten and putrid. It stank to
        high heaven. I put on rubber gloves and started to wretch as I shoveled
        out the festering mess.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had my own store of rotting badness to contend with. Slapping a lid on
        what had happened to me was not resolving anything; I had to process it
        all. I had to make sense of the pain, betrayal and misinformation. Yes,
        latterly the allotment has formed a more encouraging metaphor but I had
        to start at the core of the problem. I had to cover my face and start to
        dig out all of the festering shit I was trying not to think about.
        <br>
        <br>
        So I started to dig. </article>
