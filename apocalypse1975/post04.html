        <h2>Part 4 I Met a Girl</h2>
        I was in love. She was fantastic she made me feel so happy. When I spoke
        she listened. She laughed in all of the right places. I couldn’t stop
        thinking about her. One day I escorted her home after class and we
        chatted so easily. She was great, pure perfection. <br>
        <br>
        I also discovered some time later that she was talking to a friend of
        hers about some smelly spotty lad who wouldn’t leave her alone. He was
        obsessed with her but she thought he was horrible. He wouldn’t leave her
        alone. One day he had followed her all the way home after class and
        wouldn’t take the hint. He was a pain in the neck. <br>
        <br>
        I had left home for the first time and was terribly lonely. The fact
        that she was kind and treated me like a human being had a profound
        impact on me. I craved attention and craved affection, this simple
        kindness was overwhelming. <br>
        <br>
        I understand why it is so hard to talk about mental health. In part it
        has to do with norms of socially acceptable conversation. We are simply
        unfamiliar with having such conversations. But honestly I really believe
        it is because we are terrified. <br>
        <br>
        Our physical health can be a great way of starting a conversation. If
        you have had surgery you get visitors, flowers and chocolates. Depending
        on the type of operation, you may even get to show off your scars at a
        party. Mental health however is a topic that is unlikely to get a party
        started and nobody wants to know about your scars. <br>
        <br>
        A few years previously there was another girl. She lived next door. <br>
        <br>
        Even now I can close my eyes and see the ambulance lights flashing
        rhythmically as they lit up the dark night. I watched this girl taken
        from her home. She was flat out on the trolley. She was slid into the
        back, the doors closed after her. <br>
        <br>
        I watched her taken away in the ambulance and soon discovered she had
        taken an overdose. I saw the upset and heartache that it created in her
        family. I knew her pretty well and she seemed quite together. I felt
        deeply upset by the whole thing. Why was I so upset? <br>
        <br>
        Yes, I was upset for her and her parents but the event had pulled me
        back from the same precipice. Dark thoughts were in my mind at that time
        too and this was a wakeup call. I started to imagine what it would be
        like for my family if I was gone. Clearly these dark feelings had grown
        up in both of us, she had acted and I was given pause for thought. She
        recovered but she will never know that her attempted suicide pulled me
        back from my own dark place. <br>
        <br>
        From this event things started to improve. <br>
        <br>
        I was completely immersed in my main hobbies. Computers and playing the
        guitar completely filled most of my time, the rest was comics and
        electronic music. I had a Sinclair ZX80 which was eventually replaced
        with a Spectrum by selling most of my comic collection. For one moment I
        did consider taking a computing course at the nearby Technical College
        but decided that this wasn’t for me. It was decided I should be a
        scientist. After all there was never going to be any money to be made in
        computers. <br>
        <br>
        At school I completed the paperwork and listed my options thus setting
        the course for the rest of my life. <br>
        <br>
        I think the big issue with depression is it limits options due to making
        decisions in mental darkness. I muddled though my O-Levels passing only
        biology outright, failing the majority of the rest. In those days we had
        things called CSEs. With a CSE if you got grade 1 it also counted as a
        grade C O-Level. Most of the O-Levels I have are in fact grade 1 CSEs. <br>
        <br>
        Having obtained such patchy grades I still had the option of pressing on
        to do A-Levels. Still determined to stick with the “I am a scientist”
        narrative I opted for Biology, Physics and Chemistry. By Christmas this
        was getting too much so I decided to ditch Physics and concentrate on
        the other two. <br>
        <br>
        It wasn’t all gloomy, there were bright spots. <br>
        <br>
        I didn’t want to go, but my Biology teacher pretty much forced me to go
        on a Biology field trip in Anglesey. The trip involved a whole week away
        from home just me and my class mates. The trip consisted of a bit of
        Biology in the day (standing in fields and rivers collecting samples and
        counting them). By night it consisted of underage drinking in lovely
        Welsh pubs with the Biology teacher vouching for us (no inconvenient ID
        required in the early 80s). We were too young to drive but the teacher
        (who will remain nameless) somehow managed to get us home via the
        winding roads of Snowdonia. I remember one day standing in a lake with
        waders on, net in hand collecting more samples to count. I was starting
        to get a bit of my confidence back, starting to feel better about
        myself. <br>
        <br>
        Around the same time my friends and I formed a “band”. I use the word
        loosely due to the fact we were terrible. I am still not sure to this
        day what style we were aiming at. I played bass guitar with a homemade
        (not by me I might add) flying V guitar. The guitar had a habit of
        re-tuning itself when played, so after about five minutes it would be up
        to a semitone out. My other friend had an imitation Fender with a
        practice amp. My third friend wanted to be the drummer. <br>
        <br>
        Given we had no money we couldn’t afford a drum kit so he would
        improvise with a chair and a biscuit tin filled with coins. It sort of
        sounded like a snare. Another friend who listened to a recording said
        the drumming sounded like somebody falling down a flight of stairs! We
        would always argue over who would be the singer but could never muster
        up the courage to actually do it. Weekends would be spent in music shops
        in Manchester looking at the pornographic keyboards, guitars and drums.
        One day my friend purchased a pair of drum sticks, my mum's knitting
        needles were spared from further bending. Given the standard of my
        friend’s poor drumming I did start to experiment on my computer creating
        electronic music. It could do important things like keep time and hold
        to regular patterns, something my friend unfortunately struggled with. <br>
        <br>
        By now I had pretty much given up on the idea of getting a degree but my
        Physics teacher had the idea that if I got a pass in my A-Level
        Chemistry I would be able to get a job working for ICI in Runcorn and
        Widnes. OK at least this was something. I remember going to the
        interview and thinking what a horrible dump both towns were. I did see
        one hero though. Whilst waiting to be called in for the interview I do
        remember Clive Sinclair walked into reception. <br>
        <br>
        At the end of it all I had a conditional offer of a job with ICI all I
        had to do was pass my Chemistry A-Level. Results day came around. I had
        failed Chemistry but had passed Biology. Bugger! ICI was now off the
        menu and I had to figure out what to do now. After much frantic ringing
        around on my behalf by my teachers I was offered a place on HND Applied
        Biology in some place called Leicester. <br>
        <br>
        I didn’t feel confident enough to get a job. All of my friends were
        going to College / University, so I went with the flow. Leicester here I
        come (which incidentally I thought was in the North East of England.) <br>
        <br>
        I remember my first day very well. The feeling that I was on my own and
        ill equipped to cope with what lay ahead. I felt I had failed in all the
        things I was supposed to do and now I was pursuing option 2 for my life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember the first day on the halls of residence. Everybody there
        seemed much more together and cooler than I. Some of them were second
        year students and they seemed like gods. So confident and articulate
        they looked so good in their expensive (80s) clothes. I was a small-town
        failure who could hardly string a sentence together I was so nervous.
        (Did I mention I had terminal acne?) <br>
        <br>
        My first day on the course was a bit of a blur. There were so many
        meetings to attend. They had a test in the first class I went to. The
        idea was to find out how much I knew. I felt like I knew nothing and
        felt like I had fallen at the first hurdle. <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately I did manage to make some friends fairly quickly. <br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately attending all of the classes was not very high on the list
        for these friends. <br>
        <br>
        This wasn’t like school, if I didn’t go to a class nobody seemed to
        worry. Not attending classes became a way of gaining acceptance from my
        friends. We thought it was funny almost, a kind of game. <br>
        <br>
        The best way that I found to fit in was to go out drinking. <br>
        <br>
        I remember once I did decide to turn up to class. <br>
        <br>
        I was seriously hung over but decided I should make an effort. There
        were two tutorials back to back. One started at 10am and the next at
        11am. I had completely forgotten that the 10am class was in the same
        room as the 11am class. I made a resolve to be at the 11am class early.
        However that also meant that I arrived at the 10am class 45 minutes
        late! The tutor went mad that I wandered in at that time. I replied
        “its’ ok I have a class in here in 15 minutes.” Understandably he was
        not a happy bunny. <br>
        <br>
        The problem with having missed so many lessons was that when I did turn
        up I had no idea what was going on. I would sit through a lesson in a
        complete daze wondering what it was all about. <br>
        <br>
        Then I met her. <br>
        <br>
        The girl, the perfect wonder that I couldn’t stop thinking about. <br>
        <br>
        I started to think, “Perhaps I should ask her out!” It took ages to
        pluck up the courage, and then one day I did it. “Will you go out with
        me?” <br>
        <br>
        “No”, she firmly replied. <br>
        <br>
        “Why?” I asked her. <br>
        <br>
        “You are not a Christian” <br>
        <br>
        What the fuck? <br>
        <br>
        She had been raised in the Plymouth Brethren with very strong
        evangelical leanings. <br>
        <br>
        This was a whole new concept to me. <br>
        <br>
        Inside my head it was all a mess. I still held onto many ideas from my
        upbringing. When my Dad had died I was so angry that I effectively
        prayed Jesus out of my life. Fuck God, I don’t care anymore. It left a
        vacuum though. I was so unprepared for living in the normal world that I
        was seriously floundering. Appropriate behaviour seemed so difficult to
        hold onto. My childhood had not prepared me for any of this. Internally
        I was at some sort of tipping point. <br>
        <br>
        “Whatever!” I backed down but still held very strong feelings for her. <br>
        <br>
        There was a gap. We still seemed to get on well; perhaps she was playing
        with me? <br>
        <br>
        So I asked her again, just to see if she had changed her mind. <br>
        <br>
        Still the answer was no! <br>
        <br>
        After about the third time she rounded on me. She had enough issues of
        her own and I was pressing too many buttons. Looking back it was a
        pretty vicious attack but something cracked inside me. I went back to my
        room at the halls of residence and wept. <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps it was time to give this God thing another go? </article>
